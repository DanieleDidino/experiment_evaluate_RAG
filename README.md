Example of Evaluating RAG systems
</h1>

The notebook can be used as a template to for the `RagDatasetGenerator` and the `RagEvaluatorPack` classes (from **LlamaIndex**)to evaluate a RAG systems.

As external document for the RAG I used the paper  "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"
(but only the first 2 pages...to make it faster)
